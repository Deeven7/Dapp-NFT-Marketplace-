Starship
Starship is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to create, buy, and host Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The application is divided into a client-side built in React and a server-side smart contract written in Solidity. Users can seamlessly interact with the application by connecting their smart wallets, such as MetaMask, via the browser.

Features
Create NFTs:
Users can easily create their own unique Non-Fungible Tokens, representing digital assets, art, or collectibles.

Buy NFTs:
The marketplace within Starship enables users to explore and purchase NFTs from other creators, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of digital assets.

Host NFTs:
Starship provides a hosting platform where users can showcase and share their NFT creations with the world.

Technologies Used
Client Side:

React: The front-end is developed using the popular JavaScript library React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Server Side:
